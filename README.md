# Identification-and-Monitoring-of-Transformer-Failures-Using-IoT

  Transformer is one of the important electrical equipment in electrical network system. Along with all other equipment’s it is very important to keep tracking of its present condition and do proper maintenance which can ensure the power continuity possibilities and reduce the economic losses. The idea here represents about the usual fault detection and taking care of consumer requirements.The aim is “Detection of transformer faults and response” to ensure the consumer reliability.

IOT:

Here IOT plays a role of diagnosed information exchange. IOT stand for internet of things which will allow the overall fault response of the system (transformer) to connect  the other networking global server system that stores data and stores the information.

The main outcomes are:
1. Abnormal heating alert
2. Oil level monitoring
3. Identifying the transformer failure 
4. Estimation of load
5. Emergency Fuse alert(HT and LT)
6. Monitoring the transformer condition in live
